# Interests

As man of few talents, I try to enjoy life to the fullest whenever I can.

## Travelling

Before CoViD-19, I was an avid traveller and had gone to many U.S. cities
with plans to go to international locations! Here are some of the
destinations:

### The United States

New York City

Dallas

### Mexico

Tulum

## Wine Club with Books

A club created with a group of friends for us to discuss
the chosen book of the month over glasses of wine and great cheese!
We had recently completed our 20th book: Girl, Woman, Other and
are now on Instagram: @wineclubwithbooks

Current Book of the Month: Hard-Boiled Wonderland

## Gaming

I love playing video games with some of my favorites of all time
being the Kingdom Hearts series.
Currently playing: God of War (2018), Fallout 4
