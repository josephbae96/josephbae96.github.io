Camp Texas is an introductory camp for incoming freshmen and transfer students at the 
University of Texas at Austin in order to help encourage companionship and community
before their arrival into the Forty Acres. As a counselor, I have helped encourage these incoming freshmen
to embrace the ideals and views that UT holds while creating friendships that will  (hopefully) last throughout their time
here at the Forty Acres. Not only that, I have provided advice and insight to the campus they will be arriving at, and
offer my support and guidance throughout their first year.


## Volunteer Work
