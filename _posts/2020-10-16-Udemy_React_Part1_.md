title: Udemy React Part 1
---

I've been trying to teach myself React! The concepts are pretty interesting
and the course had been done pretty well! You can check on my progress on Github
<a href="https://github.com/josephbae96/Udemy-React">here</a>. Or the individual
React project links on the Projects page.

The course is provided by Udemy and is called Modern React with Redux 2020 Update.
As of this post, I have finished 5 Projects and am on Section 12 of the course.

Until next time!
