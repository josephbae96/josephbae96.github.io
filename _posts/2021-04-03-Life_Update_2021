title: Life Update 2021
---

I thought it would be befitting to make an update on my birthday. With the
current pandemic and such, I've had ample amounts of opportunity to reflect
on myself and my decisions. 

Many things have happened this year (both good and bad) but I can only express
gratitude in the many friends I have made and the different perspectives I have
been able to gain by talking to many different people. As with many negative
experiences that have happened in life, it is easy to fall into anger; anger at
the situation or a specific person but this anger doesn't solve any situation 
and usually makes things much worse. I have found that it's important to see
every situation as a new opportunity to learn, adapt, and overall grow as a 
person. 

In terms of software development. I have been working on my solidifying my 
React foundation, as well as learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js,
React.js, and Node.js) and iOS development in order to have more of a well 
rounded full-stack as well as mobile experience. 

It's been a wild year and can only be described, at least with my experiences, 
as both eventful and uneventful. Dear reader, I hope you and your family have 
been doing well during these tumultuous times and I wish for the best.

Until next time!
