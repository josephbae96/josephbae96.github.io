title: Life Update 2020
---

Hello! It's been sometime since I've last posted on here.

I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in December 2018, started working in June 2019, and am now on the hunt June 2020. Life comes fast, especially during a pandemic.

It's a weird time in the world right now, but I'm currently healthy and safe and there's not much else to ask for.

With all this free time, I'm going to continue my Android projects, maybe take some more classes, and keep up with my website. I guess it's time to clean up my Github as well.

Maybe I'll even post some pictures of the meals I've been making.

Austin, Texas
