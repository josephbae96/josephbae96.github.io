Honestly when my friends and I first heard of this restaraunt, we were confused with the name and thought it was some type of soup kitchen. Turned out to be a pretty good upper middle class restaraunt.

Dallas, Texas

### Butcher's Meatballs

The best meatballs I have ever had, and I think it was the sauce that really did it.

### Butcher's Burger

The top right is a Chicken Fried Chicken Burger, the bottom left and bottom right are both Butcher's Burgers. Tasted like a normal burger with fries.
