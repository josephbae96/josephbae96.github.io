A combinational logic circuit has four inputs (A, B, C, and D) and one output Z.
The output is 1 iff the input has three consecutive 0’s or three consecutive 1’s. For
example, if A = 1, B = 0, C = 0, and D = 0, then Z = 1, but if A = 0, B = 1, C = 0,
and D = 0, then Z = 0. Design the circuit using one four-input OR gate and four
three-input AND gates.
