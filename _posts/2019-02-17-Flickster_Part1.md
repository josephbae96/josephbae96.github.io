title: Flickster Part 1 (Android)
---

As part of Week 1 of the Android Course by CodePath,I have created the 
Flickster Android application which incorporates the Movies Database API
and is able to adjust to both vertical and horizontal views. The app is
a read only application that displays the current theatrical releases
along with their movie title, movie poster, and a brief overview.

Since this is only part 1 of a 2 part application, I'm more focused on
making sure the application has all the proper components before 
continuing and working on part 2. With that said, here's some potential
changes I could make to the part one of this application which includes:

• Making a Night mode

• Create a more aesthetically pleasing UI
 
 Here's a walkthrough of the application! I'll update it if I get around
 to making those changes.
