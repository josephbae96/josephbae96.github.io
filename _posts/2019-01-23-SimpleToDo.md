Made a Simple To Do Android Application that allows a person to create a
list of items, remove the item, and edit the item. The application also
saves the item list onto the phone's local memory so that if the
application is closed, the content is not lost.

Potential updates to the application include:
• showing the movie poster if a trailer doesn't exist
• fixing an error where the app crashes when in horizontal mode
• including a night mode
• changing the UI to be more aethestically pleasing

 Here's a walkthrough of the application!
