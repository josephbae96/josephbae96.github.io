title: Flickster Part 2 (Android)
---

As part of Week 2 of the Android Course by CodePath,I have updated the 
Flickster Android application to include a movie details page that shows 
the movie  ratings, as well as release date and have used the YouTube API 
to play have a YouTube video for a trailer to be shown. I have also made
sure that the player will only exclusively play the movie trailer.

Due to time commitments, I will try and work on this app a little more in 
the near future but some potential updates to the app include:
• showing the movie poster if a trailer doesn't exist
• fixing an error where the app crashes when in horizontal mode
• including a night mode
• changing the UI to be more aethestically pleasing
 
 
 Here's a walkthrough of the application! I'll update it if I get around
 to making those changes.
