(a) Using a 3-to-8 decoder and two four-input OR gates, design a circuit that has
three inputs and a 2-bit output. The output of the circuit represents (in binary
form) the number of 1â€™s present in the input. For example, when the input is
ABC = 101, the output will be Count = 10. Write an entity-architecture pair to
implement a 3-to-8 decoder. Then write an entity-architecture pair for your circuit,
using the decoder as a component. Use the port definitions specified below.
For the 3-to-8 decoder:
port (a, b, c: in bit;
y0, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7: out bit);
For the main circuit: port (a, b, c: in bit; count: out bit_vector (1 downto 0));
(b) Simulate your code and test it using the following inputs:
a b c = 0 0 0, 0 1 0, 1 1 0, 1 1 1, 0 1 1
