  Hello, thank you for taking the time to visit my website. If there's 
    anything else I can help you with, please feel free to contact me!
</p>

My name is Joseph Bae and I am a junior Software Engineer. I graduated
from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor's of Science in
computer engineering with my core focus being on Software Design and 
Implementation.

During my time at the University of Texas, I was involved in many 
different organizations including Theta Tau,the Professional Engineering 
Fraternity, while also being involved in many social ones such as 
Camp Texas, UT FSA, and the service fraternity APO.

My hobbies include cooking, attempting to dance and learning how to dance, 
playing the piano, working out and playing video games in my free time. 

Thanks for reading!
