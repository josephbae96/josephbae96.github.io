  Hello, thank you for taking the time to visit my website. If there's anything else I can help you with, please feel free to contact me!
</p>

My name is Joseph Bae and I am currently a third year computer engineering 
major at the University of Texas at Austin with my main core focus being 
"Software Design and Implementation".

Outside of academics, I am involved in many different organizations including professional ones such as IEEE, Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering, 
and Mobile App Development, while also being involved in many social ones such as Camp Texas, UT FSA, and the service fraternity APO.

My hobbies include attempting to dance and to learn how to dance, playing the piano, and playing video games in my free time. 

Thanks for reading!
