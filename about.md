<p class="message">
  Hello, thank you for taking the time for visiting my website.
</p>

My name is Joseph Bae and I'm currently a third year computer engineering 
major at the University of Texas at Austin with my main core focus being 
"Software Design and Implementation". I'm still considering what I should 
do for my secondary core or if I should do academic enrichment instead.

Thanks for reading!
